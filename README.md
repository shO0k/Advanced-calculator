# advanced-calculator
calculator that can perform:

1.) linear algebra computations such as cross product, scalar product, and vector normalization

2.) various statistical measurements such as population and sample variance/standard deviation

3.) can compute the real and complex roots to quadratic equations

*I plan to add more advanced statistical measurements such as probability distributions and hypothesis testing, as well as possibly solutions to cubic equations*
